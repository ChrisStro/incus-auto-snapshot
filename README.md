# Incus-auto-snapshot

Since the automatic snapshot engine in incus is not sufficient for me, I have created a small script + some systemd unit files to configure auto-snapshotting with different retention policies.

```
# Install snapshot-engine
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisStro/incus-auto-snapshot/install-incus-auto-snapshot.sh | bash -
```

## Notes
- Configure
- Replication engine will follow...
